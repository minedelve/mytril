## What is Mytril ? {#what-is-mytril}

Mytril is a Svelte Library for building user interfaces. It builds on HTML, CSS and JavaScript standards and provides slender framework-based components that help you efficiently develop user interfaces of any level of complexity.

Here is a minimal example:

```js
import { Btn } from 'mytril';
```

```html
<Btn>Click on me</Btn>
```

Render

<button on:click={() => alert('Welcome to the Moria !')}>Click on me</button>
