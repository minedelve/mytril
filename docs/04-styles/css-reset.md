# CSS reset with Mytril {#css-reset-with-mytril}

Mytril’s CSS reset you provides with a solid foundation for building consistent, cross-browser designs. It goes beyond default browser styling with opinionated base styles that help achieve a clean, predictable layout across all elements in your application.

## Reset features {#reset-features}

Mytril’s CSS reset introduces a set of standardized base styles, ensuring that your project has a clean slate without unexpected browser variations. Here’s what Mytril’s reset offers beyond the browser default:

- **Box sizing**: applies `box-sizing: border-box` to all elements, including `::before` and `::after`, for easier layout management.
- **Padding and margin eset**: eliminates default padding and margin on all elements, giving you complete control over spacing.
- **Background repeat**: sets `background-repeat: no-repeat` on all elements and pseudo-elements, simplifying background management.
- **Inherited styling**: ensures `text-decoration` and `vertical-align` inheritance for `::before` and `::after` elements, creating smoother styling continuity.
- **Outline removal**: disables outlines on hover across all browsers for a cleaner, modern look.
