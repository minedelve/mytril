# Managing display styles with Mytril {#managing-display-styles-with-mytril}

Mytril provides you with an extensive set of CSS classes to control the display properties of elements. These predefined classes cover all the common CSS display options, making it easier to build responsive and adaptable layouts with minimal code.

## Predefined display classes in Mytril {#predefined-display-classes-in-mytril}

Mytril includes a range of display classes that map directly to standard CSS properties. Here are the main classes you can use in your layout:

| Class        | Properties             |
| :----------- | :--------------------- |
| none         | display: none;         |
| flex         | display: flex;         |
| inline       | display: inline;       |
| inline-block | display: inline-block; |
| table        | display: table;        |
| table-cell   | display: table-cell;   |
| table-row    | display: table-row;    |
| inline-flex  | display: inline-flex;  |
| grid         | display: grid;         |

These classes allow you to easily implement common CSS display properties without writing custom styles.

## Usage Example: Responsive Layouts {#usage-example-responsive-layouts}

Using Mytril, you can directly apply these classes in your markup to control how elements are rendered across different screen sizes. Here’s an example of how to manage responsive displays with Mytril:

```html
<header class="custom-class none md:block">
	<h1>Mytril</h1>
</header>
```

**Explanation:**

- **By default**: The header has the class `.none`, which hides the element (`display: none;`).
- **At the md (medium) breakpoint**: The header is displayed as a block element (`display: block;`).

This simple approach lets you handle responsive layouts without writing complex media queries. Mytril’s display utilities streamline the process, giving you full control over how and when elements appear based on the screen size.

Whether you’re working on a mobile-first design or scaling up for larger screens, Mytril’s display classes make it easy to adjust the layout dynamically.

You can also leverage these display classes with other layout tools like **flexbox** or **grid** to build sophisticated, responsive interfaces without manually writing CSS.
