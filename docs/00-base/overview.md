**A fast, flexible, and framework-agnostic UI library for Svelte.**

Mytril is a **pure Svelte component library** designed for developers who need **performance, flexibility, and total control over styling**.

- 👉 **No CSS frameworks required. No extra dependencies. Just lightweight, customizable Svelte components.**

## Mytril is built for developers

**Why reinvent the wheel when you can concentrate on building great experiences?**

Mytril simply provides **highly customizable** building blocks that integrate into **your** design system.
Please note: Mytril does not dictate the appearance of your user interface.

- Want to use **TailwindCSS** or **UnoCSS**? No problem
- Prefer **CSS Modules, SCSS, or Vanilla CSS**? That works just as well
- Need **dark mode or theme support**? Easy with CSS variables

**No rigid styling. Just lightweight components that give you the flexibility to style things your way.**
