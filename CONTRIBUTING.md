## Propose a Feature

Got a cool idea for a new feature or improvement? Great! Let's discuss it first to ensure it aligns with the project's goals.

### Steps to Propose a Feature:

2. Include:
   - **Problem**: What problem does your feature solve?

   - **Alternatives**: Mention any alternative approaches you've considered.

This process ensures we stay aligned and build features that benefit all users.
